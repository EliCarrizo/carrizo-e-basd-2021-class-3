                        Besides the social engineering taking (1) place by cheatmakers, there is also a lot of misinformation out there, or simple knowledge of the subject.
                        Simply put, VAC detects when someone is cheating on a VAC-protected server (2). This works delayed to catch more cheaters, because otherwise one person could just use one singular account till he finds a way to bypass VAC and then spread it. With it being more unclear what triggered it, and in what time frame, results in more cheaters getting banned and keeps them on their toes.

                        Radius (from Latin radius , ray) was discovered in 1898 by Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband Piere Curie in a variety of uraninite from northern Bohemia . While studying the mineral, the Curies removed the uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. They then produced a radioactive mixture made primarily of barium that gave off a bright red flame color and spectral lines that had not been previously documented. In 1910 the radius was isolated by Curie and Andre Debierne in their metalpure by electrolysis of a solution of pure radium chloride using a cathode of mercury and distilling in an atmosphere of hydrogen .
                        Historically, the decay products of radium have been known as Radius A, B, C, etc.
