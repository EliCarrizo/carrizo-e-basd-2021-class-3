                        Well, the Trust Factor is like an "upgrade" to the CS: GO MM.
                        It serves to provide better ratio to players and MatchMaking

                        Besides the social engineering taking (1) place by cheatmakers, there is also a lot of misinformation out there, or simple knowledge of the subject.
                        Simply put, VAC detects when someone is cheating on a VAC-protected server (2). This works delayed to catch more cheaters, because otherwise one person could just use one singular account till he finds a way to bypass VAC and then spread it. With it being more unclear what triggered it, and in what time frame, results in more cheaters getting banned and keeps them on their toes.

                        Why early access?
                        “Since the beginning of the project, back in 2018, we have been inviting players to try Timberborn. The genre of city building simulators with beavers is not the order of the day, and that is why your comments help us to know what works and what does not. And now, thanks to those comments, we can present the foundations on which the game is built: it is fun and we want to make it available to everyone.
                        We will be adding more content until launch, and with the help of Early Access members we will decide what to do next. Until then, Timberborn will continue to have that scent of work to do and freshly cut wood. ”
                        Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
                        “We expect early access to last for at least a year. We have a lot of ideas on what to do before launch (see below), but player feedback affects that process and we want to put in extra hours to serve them. ”
                        How will the full version be different from the Early Access version?
                        “Timberborn has evolved thanks to player feedback and we want to keep it that way for the rest of Early Access. Player feedback sets guidelines for what to add to the game.
